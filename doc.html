		       <h3 id="in">Introduction</h3>
		        <p>computer security, also called cybersecurity, the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. <br>uter hardware is typically protected by the same means used to protect other valuable or sensitive equipment—namely, serial numbers, doors and locks, and alarms.<br> protection of information and system access, on the other hand, is achieved through other tactics, some of them quite complex.</p>

		       <h3 id="cs">Cyber Security</h3>
		       <p>Cyberspace can be defined as an electronic medium of computer networks in which online communications take place.<br>This space is a mammoth network of hundreds of thousands of networked computers, servers holding massive amounts of data, routers, modems, and switches. <br>hese are in turn connected through tens of thousands of powerful optical fiber cables both on land and across the seas, called submarine cables.<br>So keeping these networks, individually and collectively, is everyone’s responsibility.</p>
		       <p>Now keeping this network safe for individuals, organizations and governments have become a huge business requiring huge amounts of resources in manpower and infrastructure.<br>This Cybersecurity has fast become an interesting and rewarding field for the students to concentrate on.<br></p>

		       <h3 id="co">Concepts</h3>
		       <p>The increasing Cyber threats imply that individuals, small businesses, large organizations, and government agencies are increasingly concentrating on securing their systems against all forms of cyber threats.<br>In layman terms, Cybersecurity is the act of protecting standalone computers, a network of interconnected computers, individual, organizational, and highly sensitive government and national security data from damaging Cyber attacks. <br>his process involves adopting a variety of Cybersecurity concepts to suit the needs of the users.</p>
		       <p>For a beginner, the Cyber Security basics and concepts include knowing about keeping safe from email scams, malware, virus, wi-fi security, financial scams, phishing scams, safe use of internet tools like social media, and more. <br>ven smartphones are increasingly becoming an integral part of our daily lives and need some basic protection. <br>eginners have to understand some basic concepts of Cybersecurity and subscribe to anti-virus software for personal computers and networks in small businesses to protect themselves.</p>

		       <h3 id="ka">Key Areas</h3>
		       <p>The key areas of Cybersecurity known as the CIA triad comprise of confidentiality, information, and availability.</p>
		       <p>Information is the key to everything. The confidentiality of information related to an organization is integral to all this.<br>Each person needs access to a certain type and level of information only and this amount of information accessible increases as one goes up the organizational ladder.<br>Each person is trained appropriately to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all information available to him through a password and other security tools.<br>The overall organizational Cybersecurity is taken care of by a dedicated department through an appropriate firewall.</p>
